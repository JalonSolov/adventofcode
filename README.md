# adventofcode

A repository for solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) puzzles,
written in the [V](https://vlang.io/) language.

Initial layout:

A directory for the year, with subdirs for each day.

Inside each day subdir, example input file for that day, and individual solutions named
by the GitHub ID of the person who supplied it followed by `.v` to identify it as a V
language file.

If you have a solution that is more complex than a single `.v` file, make a subdir with
your GitHub ID, and place all files there.
